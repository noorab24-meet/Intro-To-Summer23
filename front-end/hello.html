	<h1> A marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan designed to promote products or services, attract customers and achieve short, medium or long term business goals. Its ultimate goal is to reach your target audience through marketing and advertising campaigns and then get them to buy or engage with your service. It can also help you map our your target audience, as well as the best ways to reach them with tracking and insights.</h1>
	<h2>Essentially, a marketing strategy is an overarching plan that anyone deciding how to start a business, or working with an existing business use to increase visibility and ultimately their profits. It can involve anything from creating a strong brand identity to developing innovative products and services. Successful marketing strategies should be tailored to your specific goals and objectives.</h2>
